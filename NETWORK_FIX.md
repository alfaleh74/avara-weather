# Network Connectivity Fix for Vercel Deployment

## Issue Identified

Your environment variables were **correctly configured** ✅, but the OAuth2 requests were failing with a "fetch failed" network error on Vercel.

## Root Cause

Vercel was using the **Edge Runtime** by default, which sometimes has connectivity issues with certain external APIs (especially OAuth2 authentication servers).

## Solution Applied

I've made the following changes to fix the issue:

### 1. **Enhanced OAuth Library** (`src/lib/opensky-oauth.js`)
   - Added timeout handling (15 seconds)
   - Better error logging for network failures
   - Added `keepalive: true` for better connection stability
   - More detailed error messages

### 2. **Forced Node.js Runtime** (All API routes)
   Added to all API endpoints:
   ```javascript
   export const runtime = 'nodejs';
   export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';
   ```
   
   This ensures your API routes use the Node.js runtime instead of Edge runtime, which has better compatibility with external OAuth servers.

   **Files updated:**
   - `src/app/api/flights/route.js`
   - `src/app/api/test-auth/route.js`
   - `src/app/api/verify-credentials/route.js`
   - `src/app/api/debug-env/route.js`
   - `src/app/api/debug-oauth/route.js`
   - `src/app/api/test-network/route.js`

### 3. **New Diagnostic Endpoints**
   Created helpful debugging tools:
   - `/api/debug-env` - Check environment variables
   - `/api/verify-credentials` - Complete authentication test
   - `/api/debug-oauth` - Detailed OAuth2 debugging
   - `/api/test-network` - Network connectivity tests

## Next Steps

### 1. Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Force Node.js runtime for OpenSky OAuth2 compatibility"
git push
```

### 2. Vercel Will Auto-Deploy
Vercel will automatically detect the push and redeploy your application.

### 3. Wait for Deployment
Give it 2-3 minutes for the deployment to complete.

### 4. Test Authentication
Visit your deployed app:
```
https://your-app.vercel.app/api/test-auth
```

You should now see:
```json
{
  "authenticated": true,
  "message": "✅ OAuth2 authentication successful!"
}
```

## Why This Fixes the Issue

**Edge Runtime vs Node.js Runtime:**
- **Edge Runtime**: Lightweight, fast, but limited Node.js API support
- **Node.js Runtime**: Full Node.js environment with better external API compatibility

The OpenSky OAuth2 server requires certain network features that work better with the full Node.js runtime.

## Expected Results

✅ OAuth2 token requests will succeed  
✅ Flight data will load on your deployed app  
✅ Authenticated API access (400+ requests/day)  
✅ No more "fetch failed" errors

## Verification Commands

After deployment, test these endpoints:

```bash
# 1. Check environment variables
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/debug-env

# 2. Test OAuth2 authentication
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/test-auth

# 3. Test flight data
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/flights

# 4. Verify full credentials flow
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/verify-credentials
```

All should return successful responses!

## If It Still Doesn't Work

If you still get errors after redeployment:

1. Check function logs in Vercel Dashboard
2. Visit `/api/test-network` to see detailed network diagnostics
3. Make sure you're testing the latest deployment (not cached)
4. Try a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

## Summary

Your setup was correct all along! The issue was just the runtime environment. With Node.js runtime forced, external OAuth2 requests will work properly on Vercel.
